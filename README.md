# ISL-SURP

Code I wrote in the Integrated Sensors Laboratory for a NSF REU opporutnity in the Summer of 2025. Some is to operate machinery (like programming Thor Labs rails and collecting data from measurement instruments) while others are to analyze data (making simple plots and graphs). Other code is to simulate experimental setups.
